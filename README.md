# Linear-Regression-Modeling-Project-Wage-Prediction-Using-R

Analyzed the Wage dataset (ISLR) to understand how education, experience, and demographic factors influence wage levels.
Built and refined multiple linear regression models using R, applying AIC comparison, ANOVA tests, and VIF analysis to optimize performance.
Performed thorough data quality checks, EDA, and residual diagnostics to ensure accuracy and model validity.
Delivered a final predictive model with strong interpretability and insights into real-world wage determinants.
